Algorithms in Python
====================

Most of the algorithms in this repository closely follow "Algorithms" by R. Sedgewick. It currently is not the intention to get the most pythonic or fastest implementation. The idea is to first write implementations at all, then add in explanations that make use of the power of the jupyter notebook to ease the understanding of these algorithms.
